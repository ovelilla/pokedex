### Additional features

We have added two new features to enhance the user experience:

**Night Mode/Dark Mode Toggle:**

Users can switch between night mode and dark mode for a more comfortable viewing experience, especially in low-light environments. This feature can be activated by clicking the toggle button located in the navigation bar.

**Pokémon Details View:**

Users can now view detailed information about a Pokémon by clicking on it.
When a Pokémon is clicked, a detailed card will appear, displaying the Pokémon's stats, abilities, and other relevant information. This feature aims to provide a richer and more interactive experience for Pokémon enthusiasts.
